\title{featurefilter: A function for filtering features}
\usage{
featurefilter(mydata, percentile = 10, method = "A", topN = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydata}{Data frame: should have samples as columns and rows as features}

\item{percentile}{Numerical value: the top X percent most variable features should be kept}

\item{method}{Character vector: variance (var), coefficient of variation (A), or the A second order derivative (A2)}

\item{topN}{Numerical value: the number of most variable features to display}
}
\value{
A list, containing: 
1) filtered data
2) statistics for each feature order according to A or A2
}
\description{
This function is to filter features based on variance. Depending on the data different
metrics will be more appropiate, simple variance is included if variance does not tend to
increase with the mean. The coefficient of variation (A) or its second
order derivative (A2) (Kvalseth, 2017) are also included which standardise variance with
respect to the mean. It is best to examine the mean-variance relationship of the data and 
the distribution of variance of all features, for example, using the results from this function 
together with the qplot function from ggplot2.
