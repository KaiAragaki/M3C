Description: A central task in genomic data analyses for stratified medicine is class discovery which is accomplished through clustering. However, a unresolved problem with current clustering algorithms is they do not test the null hypothesis and derive p values for different values of K. To solve this, we developed a novel hypothesis testing framework that uses consensus clustering called Monte Carlo Consensus Clustering (M3C). M3C use a multi-enabled Monte Carlo simulation to generate a distribution of stability scores from null datasets with the same gene-gene correlation structure as the real. This distribution is used to derive p values and also a beta distribution is fitted to the data to cheaply estimate p values beyond the limits of the simulation. M3C improves accuracy, allows rejection of the null hypothesis, removes systematic bias, and generates p values for different values of K. We believe M3C deals with a major pitfall in current automated cluster discovery tools.
