Description: Genome-wide data is used to stratify patients into classes using class discovery algorithms. A popular option is consensus clustering, however; it is prone to overfitting and declaration of false positives. This arises from not considering reference distributions while selecting the number of classes (K). As a solution, we developed Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering (M3C). M3C uses a multi-core enabled Monte Carlo simulation to generate null distributions along the range of K which are used to select its value. M3C can quantify structural relationships between clusters, and uses spectral clustering to deal with non-Gaussian and complex structures.
