Description: Genome-wide data is used to stratify patients into classes using class discovery algorithms. However, we have observed systematic bias present in current state-of-the-art methods. This arises from not considering reference distributions while selecting the number of classes (K). As a solution, we developed a consensus clustering-based algorithm with a hypothesis testing framework called Monte Carlo consensus clustering (M3C). M3C uses a multi-core enabled Monte Carlo simulation to generate null distributions along the range of K which are used to calculate p values to select its value. P values beyond the limits of the simulation are estimated using a beta distribution. M3C can quantify structural relationships between clusters and uses spectral clustering to deal with non-gaussian and imbalanced structures.
